# odin-recipes
This project I will practice the basics of html and css. I will add a home page and 3 recipes. By the end of this I will have demonstrated that I know how to make titles, heading, lists, add images, links that go into new tabs, and change fonts and font colors. I will also use this in the future to practice different skills such as using custom fonts.
